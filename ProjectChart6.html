 TODO: 
        - figure out how to hide all of the charts except the first one.   
            STATUS: 
                Moved the creation of charts 2,3,4 into the on-click function for chart 1. They now appear when the chart 1 div is clicked 
            BUGS: 


        - once the first one is clicked, the other three appears in their respective quadrants.
            STATUS: 
                Moved the creation of charts 2,3,4 into the on-click function for chart 1. They now appear when the chart 1 div is clicked.
